| \gMap and FlatMap

Monads are a functional pattern for composing code.

This talk will help build intuition about why Monads are useful
and give LOTS of examples of when and how to use different Monads.

| \bSHALL WE PLAY A GAME?
| (Early examples from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xmYgxmhx8M)

--
```
    def g(s: String): Int = s.length
    def f(n: Int): Int = n + 1

    def h(s: String): Int = f(g(s))
    h("hello")
```














--
```
    // ignore me -- `\cf\s` and `\ch\s` override REPLesent commands
    import repl._
```

---
| \gFunctor Pattern

Let's modify `\cg\s` so that it might not return an answer.

```
    // non secure connections are discarded
    def gopt(s: String): Option[Int] =
      if (s.startsWith("https")) Some(s.length) else None
```


--
Can we compose with `\cf\s: \gInt => Int\s` now?

Function `\cgopt\s` emits an \gOption\s[Int] so can we just modify the input type?

```
    def fopt(on: Option[Int]): Int =
      on match {
        case Some(n) => f(n)
        case None    => ???     // what goes here?!
      }
```


---
| \gFunctor Pattern

We have to lift `\cf\s` into \gOption\s.

```
    // -- \cf\s: Int => Int
    def fopt(mn: Option[Int]): Option[Int] =
      nm match {
        case Some(n) => Some(f(n))
        case None    => None
      }
```


--
And same if we wanted to work with `\cf\s` in \gList\s.

```
    // -- \cf\s: Int => int
    def fList(ln: List[Int]): List[Int] =
      ln match {
        case h :: ts => f(h) :: fList(ts)
        case Nil => Nil
      }
```


--
This lifting action is the `\cmap\s` of the \gFunctor\s pattern which
allows a plain function to work on these complex types.

```
    g:    String => Int
    gopt: String => Option[Int]

    f:    Int => Int
    fopt: Option[Int] => Option[Int]

    def hopt(s: String): Option[Int] = fopt(gopt(s))
    def hmap(s: String): Option[Int] = gopt(s).map(f)
```

---
\gQuick sidetrack: What is a "context"?


We often think of an \gOption\s (or \gList\s, or \gFuture\s, etc.) as a
container which can be manipulated with `\cmap\s` or `\cflatMap\s`.  This view is
pretty natural in Scala when we talk about `Some(42)` or `List(1,2,3)`
and then call the `\cmap\s` or `\cflatMap\s` methods.


--
Another useful way of looking at things is that \gOption\s specifies some
context for the type it contains.  An \gInt\s is a non-decimal number but
an \gOption\s[Int] is an \gInt\s that might not exist (and computation with
a non-existing \gInt\s also will not exist).

A \gList\s[Int] is a type of \gInt\s with superimposed values.  Consider

```
    List(1,2,3) * 7
    List(1,2,3).map(a => a * 7)  // List(7, 14, 21)
```

A \gFuture\s[Int] is an \gInt\s that can be computed in parallel with other
\gInt\ss.


--
So a Functor provides the mechanism (`\cmap\s`) for regular functions to
work in these behavioral contexts.  (Context of \gOption\s, \gList\s, etc.)

```
   // from cats.Functor
   trait Functor[F[_]] {
     def map[A,B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]

     def lift[A,B](f: A => B): F[A] => F[B] =
       (fa: F[A]) => map(fa)(f)
   }
```


\yNote\s I learned the word "context" for this concept.  Others use the term
"effect".  (E.g., Functional programming with effects)

| \gMonad Pattern


| \bSHALL WE PLAY A GAME?

```
    type Deck = Int
    type Card = Int

    def addCard(c: Card, d: Deck): Deck = c + d

    val oneCard  = addCard(5, 0)
    val twoCards = addCard(4, oneCard)
    ...

    val game = addCard(1, addCard(2, addCard(3, addCard(4, addCard(5, 0)))))
```


--
Let's make the game more interesting.

```
    def addCard(c: Card, d: Deck): Option[Deck] =
      if (c + d < 10) Some(c + d)
      else None  // you lose

    val oneCard  = addCard(5, 0)  // Option[Deck]
    val twoCards = addCard(4, oneCard)  // \rerror\s: expected Deck, found Option[Deck]
    ...
```


--
```
    val emptyDeck: Option[Deck] = Some(0)

    val game = addCard(5, emptyDeck) match {
      case None => None
      case Some(d1) => addCard(4, d1) match {
        case None => None
        case Some(d2) => addCard(3, d2) match {
          case None => None
          case Some(d3) => addCard(2, d3) match {
            case None => None
            case Some(d4) => addCard(1, d4)
          }
        }
      }
    }

---
| \gMonad Pattern

Like `\cmap\s` we need to look for a new function that can adapt a function to our needs.
It turns out we cannot make this work for plain functions but we can make it work for
functions of the shape

```
    \cf\s: \gA => F[B]\s  // for \gMonad\s[F]

    \cflatMap\s: \gF[A] => (A => F[B]) => F[B]\s
```


--
A \gMonad\s instance for type \gF\s has the following pattern

```
    trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
      def pure[A](a: A): F[A]
      def flatMap[A,B](fa: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]

      def flatten(ffa: F[F[A]]): FA = flatMap(ffa)(identity)
    }
```

\yNote\s Even though Monad extends Functor we can always define `\cmap\s` in terms of
`\cflatMap\s` and `\cpure\s`.

```
    def map[A,B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B] =
      flatMap(fa)(a => pure(f(a)))
```

\yNote\s If we had used `\cmap\s` on the \gA => F[B]\s we would get \gF\s[F[B]].
This can be solved with

```
    def flatten[F, A](mma: F[F[A]])(implicit M: Monad[F]): F[A] =
      M.flatMap(mma)(identity)
```


---
| \gMonad Pattern

How do we use `\cflatMap\s` to build our game?

```
    type Deck = Int
    type Card = Int

    def addCard(c: Card, d: Deck): Option[Deck] =
      if (c + d < 10) Some(c + d)
      else None  // you lose

    def addCard(c: Card): Deck => Option[Deck] = addCard(c, _)

    val emptyDeck: Option[Deck] = Some(0)

    val oneCard  = emptyDeck.flatMap(addCard(5))
    val twoCards = emptyDeck.flatMap(addCard(5)).flatMap(addCard(4))

    val game =
      emptyDeck
        .flatMap(addCard(5))
        .flatMap(addCard(4))
        .flatMap(addCard(3))
        .flatMap(addCard(2))
        .flatMap(addCard(1))
```

---
| \gCommon Monad Patterns

Commonly used Monads in Scala
  * \gOption\s[A]      - types with optional values
  * \gList\s[A]        - types with values in superposition
  * \gFuture\s[A]      - types which can be computed in parallel
  * \gTry\s[A]         - types which might indicate a Throwable condition
  * \gEither\s[E,A]    - types which might indicate a priviliged (E) condition


Commonly used Monads in Cats
  * \gId\s[A]          - types without any context (\ytype\s \gId\s[A] = \gA\s)
  * \gEval\s[A]        - types with values that can be evaluated now, lazily, or byname.
  * \gReader\s[E,A]    - types parameterized by an environment (\gE => A\s)
  * \gState\s[S,A]     - types parameterized by a modifiable state (\gS => (S,A)\s)
  * \gWriter\s[L,A]    - types with values that carry an audit log (\g(L,A)\s)
  * \gReaderWriterState\s[E,L,S,A] - Monads! Monads for everyone!! (an optimization)

---
| \gNotes about Monads

* In Scala 2.11 you need compiler option \g-Ypartial-unification\s for these
  examples.  In Scala 2.12+ this option is on by default.

* \gOption\s and \gList\s are not very surprising so not going to talk
  about them.


* Do not try and start a \gFuture\s in the flatMap of another \gFuture\s
  unless the second depends on the result of the first.  If you do they
  will not run in parallel.


* Reach for \gEither\s when you want an \gOption\s that gives you more
  information about why the result does not exist.
    o \yNote\s Import `\ccats.syntax.either._\s` to get right-biased `\cmap\s`
      and `\cflatMap\s` for Either in 2.11 (Default in Scala 2.12+)
    o \yNote\s Monads only accept type constructors with a single type.
      How then can \gEither\s be constructed with two types and be a Monad?
      The Monad is actually for instances of \gEither\s[E,?] (that is,
      the \gE\s is fixed).  So if you are flatMapping over an
      \gEither\s[HttpError,A] you cannot mix in other types of \gEither\ss
      (e.g., \gEither\s[JValue,A]) without adapting the left type to
      an \gHttpError\s.


* Reach for \gTry\s when the priviliged condition of \gEither\s is a
  \gThrowable\s.


* The \gId\s Monad is a wrapper to allow plain types to have a `\cmap\s` and
  `\cflatMap\s` so they can be used in Monad Transformers.  Similarly \gEval\s
  wraps plain types to be evaluated now, lazily, or byname.  These are
  used internally by Cats.
    o \yNote\s To get a value out of an \gEval\s Monad use the `\cvalue\s`
      method.

---
| \gReader Monad

The Reader Monad is a wrapper for \gE => A\s.  The \gE\s represents
some sort of environment used to calculate the answer.  You can use
Reader to compose many \gE => A\s together and then supply the
resulting composition of functions with an enviroment to act on.


To create a Reader use the wrapper directly, supplying a function that
accepts the environment and produces an answer.

```
    case class Reader[E,A](run: E => A) {
      def apply(e: E): A => run(e)

      def local[EE](f: EE => E): Reader[EE,A] =
        Reader(le => run(f(le)))
    }


    // Reader { env => ...; answer }
    val myReader: Reader[Config,String] = Reader(c => c.hostname)
```


--
Reader also has an adapter method named `\clocal\s`.  If you have a
\gReader\s[E,A] and some larger environment \gEE\s that contains
an \gE\s you can use `\clocal\s` to create a \gReader\s[EE,A].

```
    val classReader: Reader[Accumulators, IndexPhaseImpl] =
      Reader(accs => new IndexPhaseImpl(accs))

    val contextReader: Reader[PipelineContext, IndexPhaseImpl] =
      Reader.local(_.accumulators)
```

---
| \gReader Example

Engine has many Spark phase implementations.  Each is a class which
needs a \gPipelineContext\s (a case class of service instances --
accumulators, auditlogs, etc).

```
    type T = MasterProfileFrameworkConfig
    type Payload[A] = (Dataset[A], T)
```


Each phase has an `\capply\s` method which accepts a \gPayload\s[I] and
emits a \gPayload\s[O] (where \gI\s might in fact be \gO\s).  It was
decided to avoid being able to update \gT\s so We introduced a Reader
in the \gPipelinePhase\s trait to aid creating pipelines taking a
constant \gMasterProfileFrameworkConfig\s.

```
    def reader: Reader[T, Dataset[I] => Dataset[O]] =
      Reader(config => (ds: Dataset[I]) => apply(ds -> config))
```


--
This allowed us to create pipelines with `\cfor\s`/`\cyield\s`.
f(a)
```
    val pipeline =
      for {
        datastew <- new DataStewardshipPhaseImpl(context).reader
        dvd <- new DVDReportPhaseImpl(context).reader
        validate <- new ValidationPhaseImpl(context).reader
        index <- new IndexPhaseImpl(context).reader
        ...
      } yield
        dataStew
          .andThen(dvd)
          .andThen(validate)
          .andThen(index)
          ...

    pipeline(frameworkConfig)
```


--
Later we will talk about Monad Transformers and the use of \gReaderT\s
to clean up the repeated use of `context` (slide 21).

---
| \gState Monad

The State Monad is a wrapper for functions of shape \gS => (S, A)\s.  These
are functions that accept some type of state, can calulate with the state,
and also modify the state used by downsteam computations.  Once these functions
are composed together you can supply an initial state and recover the final
state and answer.


To create a State Monad use the wrapper directly, supplying a function that
accepts state and returns a possibly new state and an answer.

```
    case class State[S,A](run: S => (S,A)) {
      def runS(s: S): S = run(s)._1
      def runA(s: S): A = run(s)._2

      def modify(f: S => S): State[S,Unit] = State(s => (f(s), ()))
      def inspect(f: S => B): State[S,B] = State(s => (s, f(s)))
      def get: State[S, S] = inspect(identity)
    }


    // State { s => ...; new_s -> answer }
    val myState: State[S, A] = State{ s =>
      val answer = getAnswer(s)
      val ns = calcNextState(s, answer)

      ns -> answer
    }
```


--
State has helper functions which allow you to run the composition but only
return the \gS\s or the \gA\s.  They are named, unimaginatively,
`\crunS\s` and `\crunA\s`.

Other useful helpers are `\cmodify\s`, `\cinspect\s`, and `\cget\s`.


--
\yNote\s Cats implements State using an \gEval\s Monad under the covers.
When you use `\crun\s`, `\crunS\s`, or `\crunA\s` you will get back an
\gEval\s.  Call its `\cvalue\s` method to get your result.

      val ns = s + 1
      ns -> colors(ns % colors.length)
    }

    val game17 = game1.run(7).value
    val game20 = game2.run(0).value
```

---
| \gWriter Monad

Writer is a Monad that can compose operations on a type that also includes a
log facility.  The log facility has to be a Monoid which means there is some

```
    def combine(a1: L, a2: L): L
```

for the log type.  Since \gList\s has an O(n) `\c++\s` it is highly recommended
to use \gVector\s or \gChain\s (from \ycats-core\s) as the type for the log facility.


To create a Writer use the wrapper directly, supplying a log entry and the
answer value.

```
    case class Writer[L: Monoid, A](written: L, value: A) {
      def tell(l: L): Writer[L, Unit]
    }


    // With Writer often useful to create helpers
    def write[A](v: A): Writer[Vector[String],A] = WriterT.liftF[Id,Vector[String],A](v)
    def write[A](l: String, v: A): Writer[Vector[String],A] = Writer(Vector(l), v)
    def tell(l: String): Writer[Vector[String],Unit] = Writer.tell(Vector(l))

    // Writer(log_entries, answer)
    write("hostname", "lripple-wsm")
    write("port", 4080)
```

---
| \gWriter Example

```
    import cats._, data._, implicits._

    type Logged[A] = Writer[Vector[String], A]

    def write[A](l: String, v: A): Logged[A] = Writer(Vector(l), v)
    def tell(l: String): Logged[Unit] = Writer.tell(Vector(l))

    def gcd(a: Int, b: Int): Logged[Int] =
      if (b == 0)
        write(s"Finished with $a", a)
      else
        tell(s"$a mod $b = ${a % b}").flatMap(_ => gcd(b, a % b))

    val result = gcd(36,62).run

    val answer = result._2
    val log = result._1.mkString("  ", "\n   ", "")
```

| \g Monad Transformer Example

Recall our State game (slide 15).

It works by closing over `colors`.  We've seen that we can create a composition of
functions that take an environment using a Reader Monad (\gE => A\s).  We can use
the ReaderT Monad Transformer to construct an \gE => State[S, A]\s.

--
```
    import cats._, data._, implicits._

    type GameState[A]  = State[Int, A]
    type GameReader[A] = ReaderT[GameState, Array[String], A]

    // \gGameReader\s[A] wraps \gArray[String] => State[Int, A]\s

    def ci(cs: Array[String], i: Int): String = cs(i % cs.length)

    val addOne: GameReader[String] =
      ReaderT { colors => State { s =>
          val ns = s + 1
          ns -> ci(colors, ns)
        } }

    val addTwo: GameReader[String] =
      for {
        _ <- addOne
        a <- addOne
      } yield a

    val choose: GameReader[String] = ReaderT(colors => State.inspect(s => ci(colors, s)))


    val game =
      for {
        _ <- addOne
        _ <- addTwo
        _ <- addOne
        a <- choose
      } yield a

    val first  = game.run(Array("Red", "Blue", "Green")).run(0).value
    val second = game.run(Array("Red", "Blue", "Green", "Cyan")).run(3).value
```

---
| \g Monad Transformer Internals

Suppose we are writing a web service that calls out to a database.  The service uses Future
so we can handle many requests in parallel.  Our database might not have the data we are
seeking.  We end up with a Future[Option[A]].  Can we `\cmap\s` on this?  Yes, with a bit
of ceremony.

```
    val foa = Future.successful(Some(42))

    foa.map(oa => oa.map(a => a + 1))
```


--
How about `\cflatMap\s`?  Again, yes, taking care to get the shape correct.

```
    // Remember -- we need \gA => Future[B]\s where B is \gOption\s[B]
    foa.flatMap { oa =>
      Future.successful(
        oa.flatMap(a => if (a < 10) Some(a + 1) else None)
      )
    }
```


--
Something to notice here is that we never use knowledge of Future but only
of \gFunctor\s[Future] and \gMonad\s[Future] (for `\cmap\s` or '\cflatMap\s`).  We could
have replaced \gFuture\s with any Monad instance.

```
    case class OptionT[F[_], A](value: F[Option[A]]) {

      def map(f: A => B)(implicit F: Functor[F]): OptionT[F, B] =
        OptionT(F.map(value)(_.map(f))

      def flatMap(f: A => OptionT[B])(implicit F: Monad[F]): OptionT[B] =
        F.flatMap(value) {
            case Some(a) => f(a)
            case None => OptionT( F.pure(Option.empty[B]) )
        }
```

Since Monad Transformers are also Monads we can build up several layers.


---
| \gMonad Transformer Patterns

Monad Transformers in Cats
  * \gOptionT\s[F,A]   - value: \gF\s[Option[A]]
  * \gEitherT\s[F,E,A] - value: \gF\s[Either[E,A]]
  * \gReaderT\s[F,E,A] - value: \gE => F[A]\s
  * \gStateT\s[F,S,A]  - value: \gS => F[(S,A)]\s
  * \gWriterT\s[F,L,A] - value: \g(L,F[A])\s


--
The Monad Transformers are named for how they act.  Since the F is accessed
generically via the Functor or Monad an \gOptionT\s seems to act like an Option
being Some or None.  \gA ReaderT\s composes to allow you to provide an environment
which then exposes another Monad (like in our \gGameReader\s example).

```
    type MPFC = MasterProfileFrameworkConfig
```

In Engine we've used a \gReaderT\s[Reader[MPFC,?],PipelineContext,A] to remove
the need to provide `context` during for/yield construction (slide 13).  Now a
pipeline call is simply

```
    pipeline.run(context).run(frameworkConfig)
```


--
Typelevel also has a Monad Transformer Library called \ycats-mtl\s which makes
it easier to work with nested Monad Transformers.  These slides are only talking
about the basics available from \ycats-core\s.  If you ever end up working with a

```
    \gOptionT\s[EitherT[StateT[List,Int,?],Exception,?],A]
```

give \ycats-mtl\s a look.

Here is code that I wrote the other day.

```
    val updatedIndividualCP =                                                 // 1
      for {                                                                   // 2
        individualCP <- contactPointCol.individualContactPoint                // 3
        personName <- Option(individualCP.personName).filterNot(_.isEmpty)    // 4 Ok to be None
        pn <- nameParser.parseWithThreshold(personName).orElse {              // 5
          accumulators.incrementAcc(ReIndexNameParseFailureAccKey)            // 6 incr AccKey on None
          None                                                                // 7
        }                                                                     // 8
      } yield individualCP.copy(                                              // 9
        salutation = pn.salutation,                                           // 10
        firstName = pn.firstName,                                             // 11
        lastName = pn.lastName,                                               // 12
        middleName = pn.middleName,                                           // 13
        secondLastName = pn.secondLastName,                                   // 14
        nameSuffix = pn.nameSuffix                                            // 15
      )                                                                       // 16
                                                                              // 17
      if (updatedIndividualCP.isEmpty)                                        // 18
        contactPointCol                                                       // 19
      else                                                                    // 20
        contactPointCol.copy(individualContactPoint = updatedIndividualCP)    // 21
```

| \gAn Interesting Case

Using a Monad Transformer we can remove the random I/O in the middle of our
calculation.


```
    // Needs Scala 2.12+ or a hand-crafted \gMonad\s[Either[E,?]] for Scala 2.11

    import cats._, data._, implicits._
    import com.salesforce.cre.maus.syntax.thrush._    // a |> f == f(a)

    type MpakEither[A] = \gEither\s[MasterProfileAccKey, A]
    type OptT[A] = \gOptionT\s[MpakEither, A]

    // \gOptT\s[A] wraps \gEither\s[MasterProfileAccKey, Option[A]]

    val updatedIndividualCP: OptT[IndividualContactPoint] =
      for {
        individualCP <- contactPoint.individualContactPoint |> OptionT.fromOption
        personName <- (individualCP.personName |> OptionT.pure)
                        .filterNot(_.isEmpty)
        pn <- (NameParser.parseWithThreashold(personName) |> OptionT.fromOption)
                .foldF(Left(ReIndexNameParseFailureAccKey))(a => Right(Some(a)))
      } yield individualCP.copy(
          salutation = pn.salutation
          firstName = pn.firstName
          lastName = pn.lastName
          middleName = pn.middleName
          secondLastName = pn.secondLastName
          nameSuffix = pn.nameSuffix
      )

      updatedIndividualCP.fold(contactPointCol){ updated =>
        contactPointCol.copy(individualContactPoint = updated)
      }
        .valueOr { key =>
          accumulators.incrementAcc(key)
          contactPointCol
        }
```


The win here is removing the I/O call to `accumulators` from inside our computation
of `updateIndividualCP`.  Working with the plain data result we can increment on
`accumulators` or continue transforming as desired.
